## üìù Description

This is a habit tracker application that allows users to add habits, set frequency and log completed habits everyday. It's inspired by James Clear‚Äôs book Atomic Habits that highlights how incremental changes to your everyday life can lead to remarkable results in the long run. Each person has their own set of goals and this allows users to see the progress and their change using their own data & input.
